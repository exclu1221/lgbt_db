Data Analysis Project using IMDb data


This is a python webscraping program using BeautifulSoup to pull down data from IMDb for movies and TV shows that have been tagged as having lgbt content. 

The .csv file is currently the output from the program (6/6/21).

The goal is to analyze the data over time with respect to genres, ratings, and count. Eventually I'd like to add data regarding language and country.

I'm going to be using other libraries to analyze and plot the data: pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 

Feel free to leave recommendations. 

Thank you.
